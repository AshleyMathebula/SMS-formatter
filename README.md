## üèÜ Project Impact

Before this tool, formatting phone numbers, short codes, and text entries into the required SMS-ready format was manual and time-consuming. Staff had to check each line, add the country code (27) if missing, remove leading zeros, and then format the output correctly. This process could take hours depending on the file size.

With the SMS Formatter:

- The entire process is now fully automated.

- Numeric entries are normalized automatically (adds 27, removes leading zeros).

- Text entries and short codes are preserved without errors.

- All entries are formatted in the ?, ?, <entry> pattern in seconds.

- Large files that previously took hours can now be processed in less than 10 minutes, improving efficiency and reducing human error.
